<h1>This is my reflection on creating the dragon clicker project.</h1>
  
  <h2> Dragon Clicker Project 1.0</h2>
    
   For this first iteration of the dragon clicker project, I attached an onclick event to my dragon image to execute a javascript function that increased my clickNumber variable +1 every time the image was clicked.
   
    <h2> Dragon Clicker Project 2.0</h2>
    
    For the second iteration of the dragon clicker project, I simply doubled the images, and javascript code to get a second dragon to count clicks on. This approach was quick and easy and seems to work very well at accomplishing the goal of the clients updated request. I used a CSS filter to change the visual appearance of the dragon images.
